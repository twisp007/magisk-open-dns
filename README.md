## Description
Use Open DNS servers instead of the ones provided by your ISP or Access Point.

Open DNS uses anycast servers. Using anycast means you will always be connected to the best (faster, nearer) DNS server. Google DNS also does the same but Open DNS reach and presence is much more far and wide. From where I am Google DNS is serving me from far away countries but Open DNS has several servers in my own country.
